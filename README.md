## 🧠 About Me

I am an engineer with **8+ years of experience building applied AI and machine learning solutions**, specialising in **computer vision, data‑driven modelling, and end‑to‑end ML pipelines**.

My work focuses on **translating advanced research into deployable, production‑ready systems**, with experience taking ideas from **experimental models to scalable, reproducible AI solutions** used in real‑world environments.

I have a strong background working with **image‑ and signal‑rich datasets**, developing and validating ML models, and engineering solutions that prioritise **robustness, interpretability, and real‑world impact**.

<!-- 🔧 TWEAK:
- Change "8+ years" if you want to make this more conservative
- Replace "real‑world environments" with "production systems" or "clinical settings"
-->

---

## 🚀 What I Work On

- End‑to‑end **applied ML pipelines** (data → model → evaluation → iteration)
- **Computer vision systems** for detection, tracking, and measurement
- Model optimisation for **performance, reliability, and generalisation**
- Bridging the gap between **research prototypes and deployable AI systems**
- Collaboration with cross‑functional teams to deliver usable ML solutions

---

## 🏗️ Industry‑Relevant Experience

- Designed and implemented **scalable ML workflows** for imaging and sensor‑based data
- Developed **CNN‑based and classical ML models** for real‑world tasks
- Built **automated CV pipelines** for object detection, tracking, and inference
- Emphasised **reproducibility, validation, and performance benchmarking**
- Delivered AI‑driven solutions end‑to‑end, from concept to working system

<!-- 🔧 TWEAK:
- Replace "industry‑relevant" with a specific domain if targeting a niche
  (e.g., "Healthcare AI", "Vision Systems", "Applied ML Platforms")
